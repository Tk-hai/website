		<p>
			I plan to move to Houston, Texas after graduating this summer. I hope to find an extry level Cyber Security job that will give me plenty of experience so one day I can start climbing to positions. I am very fascinated with the whole ethical hacker thing or just testing the security of the company. I hope to be able to work at home and retire at an early age so that I can one day travel the world. It is a big goal to accomplish, but I will work hard to ensure that it is fulfilled.
